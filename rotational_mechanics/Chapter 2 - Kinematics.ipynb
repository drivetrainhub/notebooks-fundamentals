    "### Rotating Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this notebook, a physical rotating system is a collection of bodies that rotate based on the conditions and constraints applied to the system.  Many types of numerical analyses are possible for rotating systems, depending on the fidelity of the mathematical model.  Types of analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statics (linear and nonlinear)\n",
    "1. Kinematics (rigid body motion)\n",
    "1. Steady-state dynamics (linearized frequency-domain)\n",
    "1. Transient dynamics (linear and nonlinear time-domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on *kinematics*, the rigid body motion of rotating systems.  It is the most fundamental to assessing the operation and performance of a drivetrain, requiring the least fidelity to mathematically model and solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kinematics\n",
    "\n",
    "The kinematics of a three-dimensional system of bodies is considered throughout this notebook.  To simplify analysis without misrepresenting the physical system, an axis of rotation is assumed for each rotating body.  Plus, any rotational couplings between bodies are assumed to affect only motion about each axis of rotation.  \n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: center; font-weight: bold;\">Axis of rotation in three-dimensional space</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions allow analysis of a three-dimensional system of arbitrarily oriented bodies to be simplified to the analysis of a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) for each body.  Without this simplification, each body would have 3-DOF that require solving, i.e. rotation about three orthogonal axes.  Specifically, kinematics is interested in the rate of change for the DOF, $\\theta$, about the axis of rotation:\n",

The field of *kinetics*, sometimes generally referred to as *dynamics*, is concerned with those quantities.  Kinetics is outside the scope of this notebook.\n",

Therefore, the assumption of single-axis rotation is valid.  For transient dynamic analysis, it is recommended to model the full 6-DOF system to capture any off-axis rotations. \n",
